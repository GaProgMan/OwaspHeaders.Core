## My Question

Please provide as much detail about the feature or HTTP header that you are requesting here. If you are requesting an HTTP header, please link to both the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [OWASP Secure Headers Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#div-headers) pages for that header.

## Minimal Code Sample

The following is a [minimal code sample](https://gaprogman.github.io/OwaspHeaders.Core/Minimal-Code-Sample/) which helps to highlight the potential design for the feature or HTTP header.

```cs
// in Program.cs
app.UseSecureHeadersMiddleware();
```
