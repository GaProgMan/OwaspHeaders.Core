An ASP.NET Core middleware designed to increase web application security by adopting the recommended [OWASP] recommended values for HTTP headers as per the [OWASP Secure Headers] project into all responses generated by the ASP.NET Core pipeline.

Listing and commenting on the default values that this middleware provides is out of scope for this readme. Please note that you will need to read through the above link to the Secure Headers Project in order to understand what these headers do, and the affect their presence will have on your applications when running in a web browser.

{: .warning }
This middleware **DOES NOT SUPPORT BLAZOR OR WEBASSEMBLY APPLICATIONS**. This is because setting up secure HTTP headers in a WebAssembly context is a non-trivial task.

## Quick Start

Assuming that you have an ASP .NET Core project, add the NuGet package:

```bash
dotnet add package OwaspHeaders.Core
```

Alter the program.cs file to include the following:

```csharp
app.UseSecureHeadersMiddleware();
```

This will add a number of default HTTP headers to all responses from your server component.

The following is an example of the response headers from version 9.0.0 (taken on November 19th, 2024)

```plaintext
Cache-Control: max-age=31536000;private
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000;includeSubDomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 0
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self';object-src 'self';block-all-mixed-content;upgrade-insecure-requests;
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none;
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
```

{: .note }
The above example contains only the headers added by the Middleware.

## Server Header: A Warning

The default configuration for this middleware removes the `X-Powered-By` header, as this can help malicious users to use targeted attacks for specific server infrastructure. However, since the `Server` header is added by the reverse proxy used when hosting an ASP .NET Core application, removing this header is out of scope for this middleware.

In order to remove this header, a `web.config` file is required, and the following should be added to it:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
    <system.webServer>
        <security>
            <requestFiltering removeServerHeader="true" />
        </security>
    </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

The above XML is taken from [this answer on ServerFault].

The `web.config` file will need to be copied to the server when the application is deployed.
