# Feature Specification: Clear-Site-Data Header Support

**Feature Branch**: `001-clear-site-data`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Clear-Site-Data header missing. We need to implement the Clear-Site-Data so that the server can tell the client when to clear things like cookies, cache, etc.
This will help consumers of the middleware to be sure that when a user logs out of their applications the cache is cleared. This will help to reduce the chances of a session hijack (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking)
If we were to write a user story, it would be along the lines of:
As a user of the OwaspHeaders middleware, I would like to be able to set the Clear-Site-Data header for specific URL paths (such as /logout), so that I can be sure that the browser will clear all cached data for the session.
The Owasp Secure Headers Project describes the Clear-Site-Data at the following page: https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/#clear-site-data ; with the "Example" being their recommended header value. Th Owasp provided example should be the default values for the header.
For more infromation, the Clear-Site-Data header is also described at MDN here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Clear-Site-Data
There is a pre-existing GitHub issue for this header: https://github.com/GaProgMan/OwaspHeaders.Core/issues/32"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the OwaspHeaders middleware, I want to configure the Clear-Site-Data header for specific URL paths (such as logout endpoints) so that when users log out of my application, their browsers automatically clear cached session data, reducing the risk of session hijacking and ensuring complete logout security.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the middleware is configured with Clear-Site-Data header for `/logout` path, **When** a user accesses the logout endpoint, **Then** the response includes the Clear-Site-Data header with OWASP recommended values
2. **Given** the middleware is configured with default Clear-Site-Data settings, **When** any configured path is accessed, **Then** the header instructs the browser to clear cache, cookies, and storage (`"cache","cookies","storage"`)
3. **Given** the middleware is configured with custom Clear-Site-Data values for a specific path, **When** that path is accessed, **Then** the response includes only the custom-specified data types to clear
4. **Given** the middleware is not configured for Clear-Site-Data on a path, **When** that path is accessed, **Then** no Clear-Site-Data header is present in the response
5. **Given** overlapping path configurations exist (e.g., `/logout` and `/account/logout`), **When** the more specific path is accessed, **Then** the more specific configuration takes precedence

### Edge Cases
- **Overlapping paths**: When multiple paths are configured (e.g., `/logout` and `/account/logout`), the more specific path takes precedence
- **Invalid directive values**: System throws `ArgumentException` following existing middleware patterns (see `SecureHeadersMiddlewareBuilder` class)
- **Non-existent paths**: Clear-Site-Data configuration for non-existent paths has no effect but doesn't cause errors
- **Header conflicts**: Clear-Site-Data operates independently of other security headers without conflicts

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow configuration of Clear-Site-Data header for specific exact URL paths (header only appears for explicitly configured paths)
- **FR-002**: System MUST use OWASP Secure Headers Project recommended default values (`"cache","cookies","storage"`) when no custom values are specified
- **FR-003**: System MUST support all standard Clear-Site-Data directives: "cache", "cookies", "storage", "executionContexts", and wildcard "*"
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow path-specific customization of which data types to clear
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate Clear-Site-Data directive values and throw `ArgumentException` for invalid configurations, following existing middleware error handling patterns
- **FR-006**: System MUST support exact path matching only (no wildcards or regex) to ensure explicit and testable configurations
- **FR-007**: System MUST follow the Clear-Site-Data header specification as defined by W3C and documented in MDN
- **FR-008**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with existing OwaspHeaders middleware without breaking existing functionality
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear configuration examples and documentation for common logout scenarios
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain backwards compatibility with existing middleware configurations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Clear-Site-Data Configuration**: Represents the settings for when and how to apply the Clear-Site-Data header, including target paths and directive values
- **Path Pattern**: Defines URL patterns that should trigger the Clear-Site-Data header inclusion
- **Data Directive**: Specifies which types of client-side data should be cleared (cache, cookies, storage, executionContexts, or all with wildcard)
